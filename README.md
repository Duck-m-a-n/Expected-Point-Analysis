Visuals explaining EP

Introduction to Virgil Carter and Robert Machol's revolutionary research paper “Operations Research on Football” from 1970.

This notebook first visually demonstrates the main theory that field position at the start of an offensive drive directly affects the probability of scoring.
Then shows how new developments such as “yards to go” and down have allowed for deeper analysis.

To ultimately lead to the determination of the specific value of downs in certain field positions.

This journey through visualizations finally results in the strategy “Stay om Schedule” which offensive coordinators use for play-calling and what most offensive coordinators use for play-calling.
